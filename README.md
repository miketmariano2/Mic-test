# Mic-test

Changes made in consolidation pre 5PM build on 10/19: Check Level_Design Branch!
- consolidated echolocation shader branch with Joi's level branch
- lightly modded FPS controller
- echolocation generation is now through pressing the key m (stand in for mic)
- main branch of Mike's mic input does not seem to register audio on Momo's device (main branch). For now the attached script component is unattached on the FPS controller
- consolidated the location of scenes, files, scripts (that's what the delete commits are for for redundancy), made prefabs for ease of use/updating etc

The player can now move around, look around and generate ripples with the m key. Sort out mic registration on separate devices in class.
